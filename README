Branch Intentions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I have to differing approaches in mind, unsure which I will try first

* filtering content and/or use a table sortable columns
* want to be able to control the number of asset records
* be able to upload images from page/post/sidebar admin
* edit inplace for titles
* ability to filter files by type mime or suffix
* ablity to control size of image inserted into content (use size keywords like gmail - maybe)
* list non image type and insert them as text links
* be able to control image class & alt text
* option to name/Title an image on upload
* ability to search assets by name/Title within a type when inserting asset in to content
* display a icon for common file type when in admin (eg pdf, swf, doc - when a thumb should not be generated) // or don't display the image at all and display the thum on mouseover and a large in a light box editinplus in the lightbox? or edit inplace in the list
* mass upload (this eludes me still)

these are both interesting - trying the list nav first - but the listmenu might be useful inplace

more interesting stuff - idea to group assets and have two of these - first lists types - second lists files corresponding to type (first(images|pdfs|swf|tla|etc) second(item1,item2,item3,....,itemN)) - clicking on any thing in first changes second clicking anything in seconds displays a jlm view to control insertion of content

 * Also some other ideas from My fork are in here where justified (full toggle - I think its great - it could be skipped)
 * For admin stuff from my fork may never work with IE (I don't think anyone should use IE at all for any meaning stuff BTW the German Gov urges it population to not use IE)
 * I feel all the better for ignoring IE for admin of wildflower - better browser that do more exist

Wildflower 1.3 Beta - A CakePHP CMS
***********************************

Requirements
============

    * Apache web server with mod_rewrite
    * No problem to run under some other web server like lighttpd or IIS, you just need to emulate the mod_rewrite rules 
    * PHP 5.2 or higher (reported to work with 5.1)
    * MySQL 4.1 or higher

Installation
============

   1. Extract the archive. Place the 'wildflower' directory inside your apache document root or some folder under it. Of course you can rename the 'wildflower' directory at will.
   2. Create a new MySQL database. Use 'utf8_unicode_ci' collation. Into this new database import the SQL dump file 'app/config/sql/wildflower.sql'.
   3. Edit the app/config/database.php file with your database connection details.
   4. You've got a working copy of http://wf.klevo.sk site. You can start working on your project by modifying the application inside the app directory. When a new release of Wildflower comes, you simply update the cake, vendors and wildflower directories.
   5. The admin area is located under 'http://your-site/wf'. This can be changed by changing the 'Wildflower.prefix' configure key in 'app/plugins/wildflower/config/core.php'.
   6. Default login/password combination for admin area is admin/admin321 --Don`t forget to change this when in production.
   
Wildflower is not and won't be a CakePHP plugin
===============================================

WF uses the additional MVC paths CakePHP feature. All the Wildflower MVC (model, view, controller) files are located inside the /wildflower directory. Except the app_controller.php, app_model.php and app_helper.php. These are of course essential for proper WF functioning and are found standardly at the /app folder. This architecture enables you to copy any WF MVC file into your /app folder, modify it and Cake will automatically use it. Of course it's recommented to create your own controllers/models/etc. for your custom functionality, but this feature is here if you need to modify some core Wildflower functionality or do a quick hack AND upgrading won't be a nightmare.
    
Upgrading
=========

    1. Copy and overwrite all the files with the new version.
    2. Run database migrations. From your working folder launch from the shell: 'php vendors/ruckusing/main.php db:migrate'. This will update your database to the latest version.
   
Problems logging in after updating to AuthComponent enabled version? (1.3b1) / need to generate a password to insert directly into DB?
======================================================================================================================================

Use the UtilityShell to generate an AuthComponent compatible password hash:
./cake/console/cake wildflower hash myPassword

Insert the result into your database in the 'password' field of the 'wild_users' table.
